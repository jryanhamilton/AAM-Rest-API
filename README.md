# AAM-Rest-API

Adobe's Audience Manager is a powerful platform for managing audience segmentation.  This repository aims to create a straightforward introduction to the REST APIs found [in the Adobe documentation](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/audience-manager/user-guide/api-and-sdk-code/rest-apis/rest-api-main.html), as well as a usable interface for basic functionality with those APIs.

This is provided as is, and is available for whomever wants to use it for any purpose.

## Getting Started
Each notebook is broken down by the elements being manipulated within the Audience Manager system, or the type of data that is involved.  The best place to start is going to be to reference the **User Guide** as it provides a breakdown of the different notebooks, and what each contains.
