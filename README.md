# AAM-Rest-API

Adobe's Audience Manager is a powerful platform for managing audience segmentation.  This repository aims to create a straightforward introduction to the REST APIs found [in the Adobe documentation](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/audience-manager/user-guide/api-and-sdk-code/rest-apis/rest-api-main.html), as well as a usable interface for basic functionality with those APIs.

This is provided as is, and is available for whoemver wants to use it for any purpose.
