# AAM-Rest-API

Adobe's Audience Manager is a powerful platform for managing audience segmentation.  This repository aims to create a straightforward introduction to the REST APIs found [in the Adobe documentation](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/audience-manager/user-guide/api-and-sdk-code/rest-apis/rest-api-main.html), as well as a usable interface for basic functionality with those APIs.

This is provided as is, and is available for whomever wants to use it for any purpose.

## Requirements
The scripts in these notebooks were created to run with Python 3.  You can download the latest Python 3 release from [the Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

The scripts also use Jupyter Notebooks to present the materials using a web based visualization built on iPython.  Instructions to install Jupyter can be found on [the Jupyter site](https://jupyter.org/install).

*Note, you can install both Python 3 and Jupyter using the Anaconda distribution which can be found at [anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)  This is a popular distribution for data science and analysis.*

## Getting Started
Each notebook is broken down by the elements being manipulated within the Audience Manager system, or the type of data that is involved.  The best place to start is going to be to reference the **User Guide** as it provides a breakdown of the different notebooks, and what each contains.
