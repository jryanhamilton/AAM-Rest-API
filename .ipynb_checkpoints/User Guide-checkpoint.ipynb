For the purposes of these notebooks, it is assumed that these parameters are known and are in a credential configuration file called \"AAM API Credentials.json\" located in that users home directory.  This notebook helps to validate if the needed configuration file is present, and if not it creates the file and sets the needed values based on user input."
